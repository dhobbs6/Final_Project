# Final_Project: Movie Genre Analysis
## First Project Sejment
### Overview:

#### When we initially received our final project requirement, our team went through several different data set topics in an effort to find information that not only worked for our project but is also exciting. And what is more exciting than movies! Movies are watched by people all over the world, by the young, by families, for learning purposes, for romance, to pass time, for entertainment and to simply spend quality time with loved ones. Most people that watch these movies have an opinion about what they have watched whether good or bad. As a result, databases like IMDB were created to provide information about those movies. Some of the information that can be found on IMDB database is a movie’s casting information, summaries, fan reviews, critic reviews, trivia, and ratings. 

#### For our project we found a data set on Kaggle.com that had over 40,000 data points from the IMDB database that we used to analyze how different variables can impact ratings. This data set includes several details of each movie including movie length, name, genre, names of actors, names of directors, country the movie was created, average vote, critic vote, and scores on how humorous the movies were, as well as other indicators. As a group we decided to create machine learning models that can accurately predict a movies genre using these and other columns of information.

#### Now that we know our dataset, we needed to minimize and remove some of the columns we deemed irrelevant for our use with this project. This also allowed us to shrunk down the data enough to be uploaded to GitHub and to be cleaned. For this project we decided to use Jupyter Notebook to show our work and to use Tableau to create the visualizations. We will also use CSV’s to upload our cleaned and updated data into.
