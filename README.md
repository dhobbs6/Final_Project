# Final_Project: Movie Genre Analysis
## First Project Sejment
### Overview:
#### When initially trying to find appropiate data we looked at several different kind of data. Our initial idea was to use data we had found about school graduation but that dataset had too many issues. Once we moved on from the previous data we found data about movies but that data was to small eventually we found the dataset we are using currently with over 40,000 data points. The current data is from Kaggle.com and has a lot of informative features.  This data set includes several details of each movie including movie length, name, genre, names of actors and directors,country, average vote, critic vote, and scores on how humorous the movies was as well as other indicators. Looking at the dataset the group decided that we wanted to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict a movies genre using the other columns information. 
#### Before the movie dataset could be uploded to github to be cleaned we had to minimize some columns that were irrelevant. Those initial columns were the notes column and the description column. This allowed the data to be shrunk down enough to be uploaded to github for cleaning. For this project we have decided to use Jupyter Notebook to show our work and to use Tableau to create the visualizations. We will use csv's to uploaded our cleaned and updated data.
