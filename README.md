# Final_Project: Movie Genre Analysis
## First Project Sejment
### Overview:
#### For our project we choose a dataset about movies from kaggle.com. This data set includes several features of each movie including movie length, name, genre, names of actors and directors,country, average vote, critic vote, and scores on how humorous the movies was as well as other indicators.Looking at the dataset the group decided that we wanted to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict a movies genre using the other columns information. Before the movie dataset could be uploded to github to be cleaned we had to minimize some columns that were irrelevant. Those initial columns were the notes column and the description column. This allowed the data to be shrunk down enough to be uploaded to github for cleaning.
